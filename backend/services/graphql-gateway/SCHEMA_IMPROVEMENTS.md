# GraphQL Schema Improvements - Core Services Focus

## 🎯 **Completed Improvements**

### 1. ✅ **Fixed Vital Signs Field Mapping**

**Problem**: Field names mismatch between GraphQL and database

- Database: `blood_pressure_systolic`, `oxygen_saturation`, `recorded_at`, `recorded_by`
- GraphQL: `bloodPressureSystolic`, `oxygenSaturation`, `recordedAt`, `recordedBy`

**Solution**: Updated `VitalSigns` type and `VitalSignsInput` with proper field mapping comments

### 2. ✅ **Enhanced DoctorReview Type**

**Problem**: Incomplete DoctorReview type missing database fields
**Solution**: Added complete type mapping to `doctor_reviews` table:

```graphql
type DoctorReview {
  id: UUID! # maps to review_id
  doctorId: DoctorID! # maps to doctor_id
  patientId: PatientID! # maps to patient_id
  appointmentId: UUID # maps to appointment_id
  # Review Content
  rating: Int! # maps to rating (1-5)
  comment: String # maps to comment
  # Review Details
  serviceQuality: Int # maps to service_quality
  communication: Int # maps to communication
  punctuality: Int # maps to punctuality
  facilities: Int # maps to facilities
  # Status
  isVerified: Boolean! # maps to is_verified
  isAnonymous: Boolean! # maps to is_anonymous
  # Timestamps & Relationships
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  doctor: Doctor!
  patient: Patient!
  appointment: Appointment
}
```

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced DoctorSchedule Type**

**Problem**: Incomplete schedule type missing database fields
**Solution**: Added complete mapping to `doctor_schedules` table with all fields

### 4. ✅ **Added Room Type**

**Problem**: Room references in schema but no type definition
**Solution**: Added complete `Room` type mapped to `rooms` table:

```graphql
type Room {
  id: UUID! # maps to room_id
  roomNumber: String! # maps to room_number
  roomType: String! # maps to room_type
  departmentId: String # maps to department_id
  capacity: Int! # maps to capacity
  currentOccupancy: Int! # maps to current_occupancy
  # ... all other fields mapped
}
```

### 5. ✅ **Enhanced CreateDoctorReviewInput**

**Problem**: Missing detailed review fields
**Solution**: Added all review detail fields to match database schema

## 🎯 **Next Priority Actions for Core Services**

### 1. **Implement Field Resolvers** (High Priority)

Create resolvers to handle field name mapping:

```typescript
// In medical-record.resolvers.ts
VitalSigns: {
  bloodPressureSystolic: (parent) => parent.blood_pressure_systolic,
  bloodPressureDiastolic: (parent) => parent.blood_pressure_diastolic,
  oxygenSaturation: (parent) => parent.oxygen_saturation,
  recordedAt: (parent) => parent.recorded_at,
  recordedBy: (parent) => parent.recorded_by,
}
```

### 2. **Add Missing Core Queries** (Medium Priority)

```graphql
extend type Query {
  # Doctor Reviews
  doctorReviews(doctorId: DoctorID!, limit: Int = 10): [DoctorReview!]!

  # Doctor Schedules
  doctorSchedule(doctorId: DoctorID!, date: Date): [DoctorSchedule!]!

  # Rooms
  room(id: UUID!): Room
  rooms(departmentId: String, roomType: String): [Room!]!
}
```

### 3. **Add Missing Core Mutations** (Medium Priority)

```graphql
extend type Mutation {
  # Room Management
  createRoom(input: CreateRoomInput!): Room!
  updateRoom(id: UUID!, input: UpdateRoomInput!): Room!

  # Schedule Management
  bulkUpdateDoctorSchedule(
    doctorId: DoctorID!
    schedules: [CreateDoctorScheduleInput!]!
  ): [DoctorSchedule!]!
}
```

## 🚫 **Intentionally Skipped (Not Core)**

### 1. **Chatbot Tables**

- `chatbot_conversations`, `chatbot_training_data`, etc.
- **Reason**: Not core to hospital management, can be added later

### 2. **Specialty Management**

- `specialties` table
- **Reason**: Can use simple string field for now, full management later

### 3. **Complex Room Management**

- `room_types` table
- **Reason**: Basic room functionality sufficient for core services
