## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Current Progress
```bash
# See what needs to be done next
node check-progress.js
```

### Step 2: Review Project Requirements
```bash
# Read the complete project scope
cat docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md
```

### Step 3: Check Current Phase Tasks
```bash
# See Phase 1 tasks
cat docs/tasks/phase-1-infrastructure.md
```

### Step 4: Start Development
Ask Augment Agent:
```
"Can you help me implement Task 1.1: Docker Environment Setup from Phase 1?"
```

## 📊 Understanding the Progress System

### **Progress Dashboard**
- **Location**: `docs/PROGRESS_DASHBOARD.md`
- **Purpose**: Track overall project progress
- **Update**: Mark tasks as `[x]` when completed

### **Weekly Reports**
- **Location**: `docs/WEEKLY_REPORTS.md`
- **Purpose**: Weekly progress tracking
- **Update**: Fill out weekly summaries

### **Task Breakdown**
- **Location**: `docs/tasks/`
- **Purpose**: Detailed task specifications
- **Content**: Phase-specific implementation guides

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### **Daily Routine:**
1. **Check progress**: `node check-progress.js`
2. **Pick next task**: From priority list
3. **Ask for help**: "Help me implement [task name]"
4. **Work with Augment Agent**: Implement the feature
5. **Update progress**: Mark task complete in dashboard
6. **Commit changes**: Git commit with descriptive message

### **Weekly Review:**
1. **Update weekly report**: Fill out accomplishments
2. **Review progress**: Check if on track
3. **Plan next week**: Set priorities
4. **Adjust timeline**: If needed

## 🏆 Phase 1 Goals (Current)

**Target**: Complete infrastructure foundation in 3 weeks

### **Week 1: Docker & Microservices**
- [ ] Docker Environment Setup (4h)
- [ ] API Gateway Implementation (6h)
- [ ] Microservices Structure (8h)

### **Week 2: Database Foundation**
- [ ] Supabase Database Schema (12h)
- [ ] Database Migrations System (4h)
- [ ] Database Performance Optimization (6h)

### **Week 3: CI/CD & Monitoring**
