1. **Task 4.1**: Patient CRUD Operations (8h) - CRITICAL
2. **Task 4.2**: Patient Search & Filtering (4h) - HIGH
3. **Task 4.3**: Patient API Integration (6h) - HIGH

### **Implementation Steps:**
```bash
# Setup Patient Service
cd backend/services
mkdir patient-service
cd patient-service

# Ask Augment Agent:
"Help me implement Task 4.1: Patient CRUD Operations with department-based ID system"
```

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL STANDARDS

### **Service Development Pattern:**
```typescript
// Service Structure
/backend/services/{service-name}/
├── src/
│   ├── models/          # Data models
│   ├── controllers/     # API controllers
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   ├── routes/          # API routes
│   └── utils/           # Helper functions
├── tests/               # Unit tests
├── Dockerfile
└── package.json

// Department-based ID Format
{DEPT_CODE}-{ENTITY}-{YYYYMM}-{SEQ}
Examples: CARD-DOC-202412-001, PAT-202412-001
```

### **API Standards:**
```typescript
interface APIResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

---

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### **Testing Pyramid:**
- **Unit Tests** (70%): Model validation, business logic
- **Integration Tests** (20%): API endpoints, database operations
- **E2E Tests** (10%): User workflows, cross-service functionality

### **Testing Commands:**
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage report
```
